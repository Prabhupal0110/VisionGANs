# GAN Image Generator - Weekend Project 🎨

A simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built to generate synthetic images from random noise. This project was created as a weekend learning experiment to explore GAN architectures and image generation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how a basic GAN can generate realistic images by training on a dataset of images. The goal is to have the Generator produce images that are indistinguishable from real ones, while the Discriminator works to classify images as real or fake.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **Keras (Optional)**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **NumPy**

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Generator** - Takes random noise as input and generates fake images.
2. **Discriminator** - Classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (from the Generator).
3. **Training** - The Generator and Discriminator compete against each other, gradually improving until the Generator can produce realistic images.

## 🔧 How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/gan-project.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Prepare the dataset:
- Place images in the `dataset` folder.
- Ensure images are resized to 64x64 (or the size expected by the GAN).

4. Train the GAN:
```
python train.py
```
5. View generated images:
- Generated images will be saved in the `results/` folder during training.
