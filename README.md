# VisionGANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to generate new, synthetic data that resembles real data.

They were introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his team in 2014 and have since become one of the most exciting advancements in machine learning, particularly in the field of generative AI.

How GANs Work (In Simple Terms):
Imagine two neural networks playing a competitive game:

Generator (The Artist): This network tries to create fake data (like images, videos, or text) that looks as realistic as possible.
Discriminator (The Critic): This network tries to distinguish between real data (from the dataset) and the fake data created by the Generator.
The Generator's goal is to fool the Discriminator by producing data that looks real.
The Discriminator's job is to catch the Generator by identifying whether the data is real or fake.
Through continuous training, both networks improve:

The Generator gets better at producing realistic data.
The Discriminator gets better at identifying fake data.
Eventually, the Generator produces data that the Discriminator can barely distinguish from real data.
